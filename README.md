### Description
1. The Summary of project 
Our software provides a user with immersing virtual reality views through Oculus Rift device. 
The initial screen of software starts at 3D based earth-image. 
It allows a user to select their favorite regions using Leap Motion of Oculus Rift using hand motions and gestures. 
When certain site is selected, it shows its unique screen images as if one stands there. 
Thus, the most realistic world famous landmarks are provided to a user by our solution integrated, specially converted with images of Google Street View. 

2. The Aim of development 
Our target is to provide users with software which allows them to experience 3D-based realistic view of world famous landmarks. To implement this features, we develop a realism-based immersive view solution and add to existing virtual trip service. 
For more realistic view, we also aim to integrate our solution with all 360-degree images of Google Street View feature. 


3. The Requirement of project 
We research and develop the following technology for implementation; 
First, we use Oculus Rift for users to experience realistic sights on basis of their various viewpoints. 
Secondly, we transform and converts images to fit to Oculus Rift device. Street View images consists of general images and 360-degree images. For display through Oculus Rift, we need to convert them to Oculus Riftâ€™ formatted images. 
Thirdly, we provide stereoscopic control feature using Leap Motion without using control of mouse and keyboard. We use Leap Motion to prevent a user from using those traditional control devices for best exploration in virtual world trip. For Leap motion control, the depth of 3D information is required. Although Leap Motion Controller provide those functionality, it does not recognize the information of the motion. We require to develop the information of motion movement. 
Fourthly, we provide additional information to object of Google Street View images. To describe each major object of image files, we maintain its data and information accordingly.
