Rise of the Dough
-----------------

2.5D minigame featuring animations made with Smooth Moves Unity3D plugin.




IMPORTANT -- READ FIRST!!!!

Before you can run the Rise of the Dough mini game, you will need to import the Unity package file "RiseOfTheDough_ProjectSettings" from the "Rise of the Dough" folder. You can do this by going to the menu at the top of Unity "Assets > Import Package > Custom Package". After this settings file is imported, you will be able to run the game.

!!!WARNING!!! - importing the settings file will overwrite your current project settings. It is always best to import a plugin upgrade into a new project to avoid any data loss. Always back up your work before upgrading!!!

Comments
--------

Although a lot of the GUI objects are made with Smooth Moves animations, this is generally not a good practice. These elements (such as the score and health bar) serve as examples of what is possible with Smooth Moves and are intended to be inspirational only. Each animation requires at the minimum one draw call, so batching will be hampered by using animations for GUI elements. If you are interested in GUI, I would suggest looking in the Unity3D asset store for a GUI / Sprite package that will be much more effecient.
